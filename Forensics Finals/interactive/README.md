# Disclaimer

I originally hosted the challenge files on a Google Drive link at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1HdikpDVwkLbySOoPGJcoEnYDQHlxV_bu, but the drive may shut down once my email gets deleted.

So, I've uploaded them to this folder instead.

Download them and solve for your enjoyment!

## Additional Notes

- flag_in_a_million.txt had an original file size over 25MB, so I had to truncate it to upload it here.
- despite truncation, the solution method should be the same.
