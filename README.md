# Overview

NoyaCode is a student-led cybersecurity initiative in EJC started by me and a group of like-minded peers who enjoy technical competitions.

On 5th Jan 2026, we hosted a 2h NoyaCode Cybersecurity Experiential Workshop for 2026 JIP/J2 beginners.

We hosted a series of practice forensics challenges covering basic concepts like number systems, Linux commands, LSB steganography, metadata, and strings.

This repository serves as an archive of these beginner challenges with written writeups of their solutions.

In each challenge folder exists a dist folder, description.md, and solution.md.

- Read description.md to look at the challenge title and description.
- Access the dist folder and download the files inside to get the challenge files.
- Read solution.md when you want to see a walkthrough on the problem. (SPOILERS!)
